# Kaggle_Titanic_dataset

This repository is my submission in the [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster, Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). <br> In this competition, the <b>goal</b> is to predict which <b>passengers survived</b>
the tragedy.

This is a multi-label classification, with 2 labels:

- 0: passenger did not survive 
- 1: passenger survived
